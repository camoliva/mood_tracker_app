# WELCOME TO THE MOOD TRACKER APP

A terminal based mood tracking app built in Python. 

This project began as a way to practice version control and test driven development, but it quickly grew into something more meaningful. I wanted to create a simple tool that encourages daily reflection and mental check ins without the complexity of larger apps. Logging your mood even in a small way can offer surprising insight over time and building this app reminded me how powerful even the simplest software can be.

## Features

- Log your mood with a rating from 1-5
- Optional personal note for each entry
- Date added automatically
- View full mood history
- Summary of average mood
- Personalised welcome message (saved across sessions)
- Styled CLI using the `rich` library
- Error handling for empty files or bad inputs
- Built using a Test-Driven Development
- Includes unit tests


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- `unittest` (Pythonâ€™s built-in test module)
- `rich` (for terminal formatting and colored output)
